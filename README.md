## Packages

- Two classes within same name space or packages, cannot be named the same.
- Packages is both naming and visiblity control mechanism.
- Package command is the first statement in the Java File. 
- **.class files for any classes declared in a package, must be saved in the directory with the same package name.**

### Package Hierarchy
- Hierarchy of packages: `package pkg[.pkg2[.pkg3]];`
- Package hierarchy must be reflected in the file system.

### Package classpath
- Java uses current directory as working environment, so if a package is in the sub-directory of the current directory, it will be found.
